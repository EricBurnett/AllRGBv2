        2: 8x8 output image
        4: 64x64 output image
        6: 512x512 output image
        8: 4096x4096 output image

    the output will be [image name]_allRGBv2.png in the same directory.
    
Performace:
    Generating a full 4096x4096 image can take 35+ hours, and peak over 4 GB
    of memory. The fewer the number of colors in the input image or the worse
    the color balance, the longer it will take.
    
    Pixel processing rate will decrease over time, only increasing again right
    at the end.
